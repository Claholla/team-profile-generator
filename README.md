  The appication allows the user to input a series of team members and build a roster through the command line input using inquirer prompts to fill information fields about each individual teammate. When the user completes the population of their team, the application generates a webpage displaying the user loaded roster with links to email each member of the team. When applicable, the application also generates links to the team members' GitHub user pages.
